                                    GABA was founded by medical students for
                                    medical students. Like you, we started our
                                    personal medical journeys ready to excel. We
                                    quickly discovered that, aside from grit and
                                    determination, success in medical school was
                                    often a matter of having the right
                                    information at the right time. That’s when
                                    GABA was born.

                                    Rather than spending hours pouring over
                                    multiple sites for recommended resources,
                                    school reviews, and applicant data from
                                    questionable sources, we decided to create a
                                    community for the unique experience of being
                                    a medical student. GABA filters out the
                                    noise and gives our members back the most
                                    precious resource in a medical student's
